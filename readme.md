iTodo for Sublime Text
------------------
This is a fork of the original iTodo @ https://github.com/chagel/itodo

I have made significant changes to the syntax highlighting, and hotkeys, to create a more natural exprience.

iTodo is a GTD tool for managing todo list in Sublime Text editor.

Description
------------------

This plugin contains one text command names 'itodo' and a syntax definition with the same name.

Usage 
------------------

Mac: "CMD + D": toggle task completed
Windows: "CTRL + D": toggle task completed


Samples 
------------------

Suppose we have a following todo file:

	Project A:
		- call mum tomorrow at 8 am.

Highlight this item line and press "CMD + D" (Windows: "CTRL+D"), it marks a tag "@done" and also appends timestamp.

	Project A:
		+ call mum tomorrow at 8 am. @done (2012-01-08 18:12)
